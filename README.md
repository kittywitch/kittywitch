# Kat "kittywitch" Inskip

Hi! I work mostly on Rust and Nix projects.

I keep a blog about things I do at [dork.dev](https://dork.dev)!
I keep a repo of my ~/src: [kittywitch/src](https://github.com/kittywitch/src).

I am currently working on:

* [TaimiHUD](https://github.com/TaimiHUD/TaimiHUD) - A Nexus addon that provides Encounter Timers, experimental Commander's Markers and work-in-progress Pathing made in Rust.
* [katgba](https://github.com/kittywitch/katgba) - A work-in-progress Rust GBA game, using [oxalica/rust-overlay](https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay) and [ipetkov/crane](https://github.com/ipetkov/crane) to use Nix to build the Rust game for the the GBA. May currently contain a test example game from the GBA repo; will be replaced with something when have enough of something to post.
